'Well I wrote this quick little app in under 10 minutes just so

'i could get some data being sent between the irc client and server.

'but you can adapt it to suit many client server apps like napster or whatever.

'well this is how you use it. in mirc or whatever other client you are using

'set the server to connect to your local ip and port 6666 then set your nick and

'other information including server here. run this app. run your client and

'connect. this is just a quick app if you really want to see whats
